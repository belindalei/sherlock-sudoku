# Sherlock Sudoku 

## Introduction
Welcome to the Sherlock Sudoku. This game was inspired by my belated grandfather, who was a lover of Sherlock. Sudoku is well thought of as a game to help stimulate and exercise the brains of patients who have had strokes. It is with my hope that like my grandpa, others will be able to train their brains as well. 

## Installation
Type in the following commands into your server:

```bash
yarn install
rails s
```

After starting the server, open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

## Usage
The game is built with React, Rails, Semantic UI, immer and the npm Sudoku library. 


## Roadmap 
The game will continue to be developed with additional CSS styling.



### Authors and Acknowledgment
I had great assistance from watching a hackathon video by Netifly founder, @biilmann, while building the game. The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GytUZLK4kwA).
